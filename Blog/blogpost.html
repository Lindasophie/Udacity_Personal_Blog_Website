        <h1>Visit the Hogwarts Train</h1>
        <button type="button">Europe</button>
        <img src="img/train.jpg"alt="Train">
        <h2>All Aboard</h2>
        <p>For Harry Potter fans of all ages, a trip to Scotland offers a chance for us mere muggles to step aboard the Hogwarts Express for the day!</p>
        <p> However, with limited seasonal departures and setting off from a small station in the Scottish Highlands, it does take a little bit of planning ahead (ideal if you're a Ravenclaw...)</p>
        <p>In this post, we've shared all the important stuff to help you plan your trip on the Harry Potter train, from where to catch it, how to book tickets, timetables, a way to ride the train AND photograph the Harry Potter bridge, and travel tips to make the absolute most of this magic experience. </p>
        <p> Whether visiting as part of your Scotland road trip, or itâ€™s a surprise gift to the Potter fanatic in your life, we've got you covered.</p>
        <h2>Where is the Harry Potter train located?</h2>
        <p>It's 501 miles away from platform nine and three-quarters and London Kings Cross, so you best get a move on if you're reading this and have tickets booked</p>
        <p>The Jacobite steam train departs from the station in Fort William (Google Maps), and takes passengers on a six-hour roundtrip to the coastal port of Mallaig (Google Maps).</p>
        <p>Both are in the western Highlands, so you need to plan your Scotland itinerary in advance to make sure you're in or near them. Thankfully, Fort William is the perfect base for climbing Ben Nevis (Britain's highest mountain) and visiting Glencoe, so it's already a popular destination for travellers in Scotland and ideal to include on your road trip route.</p>
        <p>The Harry Potter train is not on the North Coast 500, and it doesn't depart from or pass through Inverness or Glasgow. </p>

        <h2>Harry Potter train tours from Edinburgh, Iverness, or Glasgow</h2>
        <p>f you're in Scotland for a short period of time, and your heart is set on riding the Harry Potter train whilst you're in the country, then it may be more convenient to book a tour from Inverness or Edinburgh instead of travelling with a rental car or public transport up to the Highlands.</p>
        <p>The options below are highly-rated day trips which include a guide, transport, tickets for the train, a stop at the Harry Potter Bridge and a few other places in the Highlands:</p>
        <ul id="list-places">
          <li>From Iverness | <a href="https://www.viator.com/en-GB/Inverness/d5051-ttd/p-5211P32?campaign=Harry_Potter_Train&mcid=42383&medium=link&pid=P00044714">Jacobite Steam Train and Highlands Tour</a></li>
          <li>From Edinburgh | <a href="https://www.getyourguide.com/edinburgh-l44/harry-potter-the-magical-highland-tour-by-steam-train-t121671/?cmp=Harry_Potter_Train&partner_id=2A6MSUC&placement=%22other%22&utm_medium=online_publisher">Magical Highlands Tour with Howarts Express</a></li>
          <li>From Glasgow | <a href="https://www.getyourguide.com/s?cmp=Harry_Potter_Train&partner_id=2A6MSUC&placement=%22other%22&utm_medium=online_publisher&q=Glasgow&et=402839&lc=438">A Highlands Adventure</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that these tours include a one-way journey on the train from Mallaig to Fort William so that you can visit and photograph the famous Glenfinnan Viaduct, as well as ride over it on the train. </p>
        <p>If you are looking last minute, and Harry Potter train tickets are sold out to buy direct, then it may be worth going for a tour option as they're often allocated a certain number of tickets.</p>
